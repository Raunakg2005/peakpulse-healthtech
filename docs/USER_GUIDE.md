   - 🏃 Running
   - 🚴 Cycling
   - 🏊 Swimming
   - 🚶 Walking

### Understanding Calorie Calculations

PeakPulse uses **MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task)** values:

**Formula**: `Calories = MET × Weight(kg) × Duration(hours) × Intensity`

**Example:**
- Running (MET = 9.8)
- Weight: 70kg
- Duration: 30 minutes (0.5 hours)
- Intensity: Moderate (1.0x)
- **Result**: 9.8 × 70 × 0.5 × 1.0 = **343 calories**

### Viewing Activity History

- Today's activities appear in the calorie tracker
- Each entry shows: activity name, duration, time logged, calories burned

## Understanding ML Insights

### Quantum Dropout Predictor

PeakPulse uses a **hybrid quantum-classical ML model** to predict:

**Dropout Risk**: Probability you might stop using the app (0-100%)
- **Low Risk** (0-30%): You're doing great! 🟢
- **Medium Risk** (30-70%): Stay engaged! 🟡
- **High Risk** (70-100%): We're here to help! 🔴

**How it works:**
1. Quantum circuit encodes your activity patterns
2. Classical ML model analyzes trends
3. Hybrid ensemble combines both predictions
4. 93.5% accuracy in predictions!

### Engagement Level

AI analyzes your engagement:
- **High**: Consistently active and engaged
- **Medium**: Regular activity with some gaps
- **Low**: Needs motivation boost

### Personalized Recommendations
